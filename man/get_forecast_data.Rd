reports directory.}

\item{horizons_to_include}{integer vector, horizons to
include in the output. Default: c(0, 1, 2).}

\item{file_prefix}{character, prefix used in output
filename (e.g., "covid", "rsv"). Default: "covid".}

\description{
This function fetches all forecast submissions from a
forecast hub based on the reference date. The forecast
data is then pivoted to create a wide format with
quantile levels as columns.
}
\details{
The resulting file contains the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{location_name}: full state name (including "US" for
the US state)
\item \code{abbreviation}: state abbreviation
\item \code{horizon}: forecast horizon
\item \code{forecast_date}: date the forecast was generated
\item \code{target_end_date}: target date for the forecast
\item \code{model}: model name
\item \verb{quantile_*}: forecast values for various quantiles
(e.g., 0.025, 0.5, 0.975)
\item \code{forecast_teams}: name of the team that generated the
model
\item \code{forecast_fullnames}: full model name
